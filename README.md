# Game Time
This project will be used to post various small and simple games that I've coded for practice.

## Random Number
This game gives you three chances to guess the correct number that has been randomly selected. I will most likely expand on this to change the functionality as I go.
###TODO
1. Add methods to ensure that input is valid such as chosen number and answer to playing the game again.
2. Possibly separate code into various defined functions for easier upkeep and readability.
